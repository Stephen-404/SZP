### File Splitter &amp; Merger

You are familiar with the concept of stuffing all the files and folders into one file, ex. zip.

But, what if a single file is too huge to handle, say, while uploading to drive or copying to pen-drive for an instance.



**It is a simple yet powerful command line utility that works for any file type**

  1. to split a huge file into 10 smaller '.szp' files

  2. to merge the split files into a single '_Merge.ext' file


*Its so lightweight, just few KB's and lets you to take control on GBs of huge files.*

Try it and share how it is.
